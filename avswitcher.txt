Developer notes

New intents added:
android.intent.action.BONOVO_SET_VIDEO_CHANNEL
android.intent.action.BONOVO_SET_AUDIO_CHANNEL

Each intent takes an extra data int named 'channel' that specifies the channel number to switch to.
These are set independantly, so you can switch to 'Aux In' audio without having the 'Aux In' video 
displayed.

Audio channels:
	0: Android source
	1: Bluetooth Music source
	2: Aux In
	3: Radio
	6: Bluetooth Telephone

Video Channels:
	0: Android source
	1: Aux In
	2: Aux In 2
	3: Back Video In

Advanced option:
The android.intent.action.BONOVO_SET_VIDEO_CHANNEL intent also takes an extra boolean 
variable named 'videoswitcher' which defaults to true.  By default an app is run that will
catch any back button, home button, or screen touches and revert back to the android display.
Set 'videoswitcher' to false and this app is not run so you must have something switch the mode back.

The idea for having the ability to disable the videoswitcher app was to allow something like Tasker to 
switch the video to 'Back Video In' when the Reverse intent is sent.  Then Tasker can revert the video
to the Android source when the Reverse intent is sent again.

Be careful when using this without the videoswitcher app.  You might get stuck and have to reboot to 
return to the default Android source.
